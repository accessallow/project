Aim
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our aim is to provide a better technological solution to the Institute to manage its existing work and data-load. We will be constructing an ERP system that will manage all the student's data, all the examinations data, attendance and its statistics and a messaging based interaction environment between students and higher management.
Also our efforts will be to make sure that system is capable of expanding itself in future so that further extensions and modifications can be done in it depending upon the growing needs of the organization.
