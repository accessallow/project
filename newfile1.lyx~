\begin_layout Section
Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Odoo uses a Service Oriented Architecture as a software architecture design
 pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Web Application Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most recent versions of Odoo (including version 7) are mostly implemented
 as a web application.
 Odoo includes an application server/web server (known as the Odoo Server)
 that focuses on ERP business logic, stores data through an interface with
 a database, and web client for web browsers access.
 The server and business logic portion of Odoo is primarily written in the
 Python programming language.
 The web client is primarily written in JavaScript.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Modules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Business features are organized into modules.
 A module is a folder with a pre-defined structure containing Python code
 and XML files.
 A module defines data structure, forms, reports, menus, procedures, workflows,
 etc...
 Modules can also contain web components written in JavaScript.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Database
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Odoo uses PostgreSQL as the database management system.
 PostgreSQL, often simply "Postgres", is an object-relational database managemen
t system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards-compliance.
 As a database server, its primary function is to store data, securely and
 supporting best practices, and retrieve it later, as requested by other
 software applications, be it those on the same computer or those running
 on another computer across a network (including the Internet).
 It can handle workloads ranging from small single-machine applications
 to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users.
 Recent versions also provide replication of the database itself for security
 and scalability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PostgreSQL implements the majority of the SQL:2011 standard, is ACID-compliant
 and transactional (including most DDL statements) avoiding locking issues
 using multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), provides immunity to dirty
 reads and full serializability; handles complex SQL queries using many
 indexing methods that are not available in other databases; has updateable
 views and materialized views, triggers, foreign keys; supports functions
 and stored procedures, and other expandability,and has a large number of
 extensions written by third parties.
 In addition to the possibility of working with the major proprietary and
 open source databases, PostgreSQL supports migration from them, by its
 extensive standard SQL support and available migration tools.
 And if proprietary extensions had been used, by its extensibility that
 can emulate many through some built-in and third-party open source compatibilit
y extensions, such as for Oracle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PostgreSQL is cross-platform and runs on many operating systems including
 Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Microsoft Windows.
 Mac OS X, starting with OS X 10.7 Lion, has the server as its standard default
 database in the server edition, and PostgreSQL client tools in the desktop
 edition.
 The vast majority of Linux distributions have it available in supplied
 packages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PostgreSQL is developed by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group, a diverse
 group of many companies and individual contributors.
 It is free and open source software, released under the terms of the PostgreSQL
 License, a permissive free software license.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Source code and contributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Odoo source code is hosted on the GitHub project hosting service, using
 the Git distributed revision control system.
 The documentation is published on a separate website.
