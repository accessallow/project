In the current system we analysed and inspected and finally extracted these 8 problem points. Our solution will address these problems and further improvements into the system will be based on these core problem points and its solution implementation.

(1) Student's data management
(2) Student's finantial accounts
(3) Student's attendance
(4) Student's requests/complaints/feedbacks {no-record}
(5) Student's communication with higher authorities and its record keeping
(6) College level feedbacks and its records
(7) Centralized information portal
(8) Notices and other media-delivery

We analysed the whole system and we saw that these are the key factors and stack holding pillers in the informational infrastructure of  the institute. In order to improve the quality and standard of the system we will have to improve upon the speed,ease accuracy and feasibility of these processes.
We took each of these factors one by one and studied the current process being followed in the institute to achieve these tasks. We found many flaws in the current system and saw scope of improvements in various aspects. In the next excerpts we are giving the detailed study of the current process being folloowed in the system, the problems associated with current procedures and our proposed solution.
